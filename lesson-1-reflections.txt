How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    We could spot the differences between the two files that we compared using 
	FC on Windows. As the previous version was running fine and the bug came to 
	exist after we made changes to the existing version, so it was quite obvious 
	to check the statements where we made some changes to spot the bug.
