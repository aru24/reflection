How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    We could spot the differences between the two files that we compared using 
	FC on Windows. As the previous version was running fine and the bug came to 
	exist after we made changes to the existing version, so it was quite obvious 
	to check the statements where we made some changes to spot the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having easy access to the entire history of a file can help us spot bugs 
	that creep into our code. It can be done by comparing the two files for 
	comparing differences between the code contained in the two files.
